# Project Title

With the onset of mobile health technology, there arises the opportunity and need for phone based portable ECG systems to detect and discriminate diagnosable and undiagnosable ECG signals. This report details a real time ECG detection system that is able to classify whether an acquired ECG signal is adequate for diagnostic purposes or if another recording is needed. ECG recordings have been collected from MIT_BIH Noise Stress Test Database, in which 12 collections of 6 different signal-to-noise ratios. Recordings begin with five minutes of clean, unaltered ECG data before alternating between noisy and clean ECG data every two minutes. Signal processing is designed to run on the Nucleo F303K8 microcontroller, and output the determined classification to an oscilloscope.

## How to Use

### Installation

Include any necessary steps to install and set up your code. This may include dependencies, environment setup, or configuration instructions.

### Interacting with the Code

Describe the steps required to interact with your code. For example, if it's a command-line tool, provide instructions for running it with sample commands. If it's a GUI application, explain how to launch it and navigate through its features.

## Test Inputs

List the software or hardware inputs required to test your code. This could include specific input files, signal generator settings, or hardware configurations.

## Example Test Cases

Provide example test cases along with the expected output. This helps reviewers understand how your code behaves under different scenarios.

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: [Describe the input data or parameters]
  - Expected Output: [Describe the expected outcome or result]

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: [Describe the input data or parameters]
  - Expected Output: [Describe the expected outcome or result]

- [Add more test cases as needed]
